241Beats - Honors Project for CS 241
============

##General Idea
Our goal is to build a decentralized music player which plays music on multiple android phones. All these phones will play a single playlist shared playlist that can be edited by any phone. Furthermore, playback on all phones will be synchroned so that all phones play the same music at all times. This also means that any phone can control music (play / pause / skip / etc) on all other phones.

Please note that while the app will compile, it is almost guaranteed to crash on launch if the server is not running as well. Please configure the settings for your server in the native code. I have removed the server config in the native code for to make it clearer as to what needs to be changed.

####Week of Monday Dec 7

Completed the app.<br>
Getting the ndk to play nicely took longer than expected.<br>
Server code is not on github. Only the app's code is here.

####Week of Monday Dec 1

Looked into how ndk would work in terms of our project.<br>
Got Java stuff completed.<>

####Week of Monday Nov 24

Thanksgiving week.<br>
This wasn't particularly productive.<br>
I worked a little with multithreading in Android<br>
Didn't get much done in the way of this project.<br>

####Week of Monday Nov 17

WildHacks is was this weekend<br>
I basically learned a lot about Android developement while I was there<br>
This project at Wildhacks is my first actual android app<br>
The stuff I've learned here will help towards this project.

####Week of Monday Nov 3
Hope to start development soon.

####Week of Monday Oct 27
