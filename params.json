{"name":"241beats","tagline":"","body":"241Beats - Honors Project for CS 241\r\n============\r\n\r\n##General Idea\r\nOur goal is to build a decentralized music player which plays music on multiple android phones. All these phones will play a single playlist shared playlist that can be edited by any phone. Furthermore, playback on all phones will be synchroned so that all phones play the same music at all times. This also means that any phone can control music (play / pause / skip / etc) on all other phones.\r\n\r\n##Collaborators\r\n\r\n|Name|email|\r\n|---|---|\r\n|Abhishek Modi | akmodi2@illinois.edu|\r\n|Haozhen Ding | hding8@illinois.edu|\r\n|Yisong Yue | yyue7@illinois.edu|\r\n\r\n\r\n##Demo\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NFuqrEvgzv8&feature=youtu.be\r\n\r\nPlease note that while the app will compile, it is almost guaranteed to crash on launch if the server is not running as well. Please configure the settings for your server in the native code. I have removed the server config in the native code for to make it clearer as to what needs to be changed.\r\n\r\n#Abhishek Modi's Log\r\n\r\n####Week of Monday Dec 7\r\n\r\nCompleted the app.<br>\r\nGetting the ndk to play nicely took longer than expected.<br>\r\nServer code is not on github. Only the app's code is here.\r\n\r\n####Week of Monday Dec 1\r\n\r\nLooked into how ndk would work in terms of our project.<br>\r\nGot Java stuff completed.<>\r\n\r\n####Week of Monday Nov 24\r\n\r\nThanksgiving week.<br>\r\nThis wasn't particularly productive.<br>\r\nI worked a little with multithreading in Android<br>\r\nDidn't get much done in the way of this project.<br>\r\n\r\n####Week of Monday Nov 17\r\n\r\nWildHacks is was this weekend<br>\r\nI basically learned a lot about Android developement while I was there<br>\r\nThis project at Wildhacks is my first actual android app<br>\r\nThe stuff I've learned here will help towards this project.\r\n\r\n####Week of Monday Nov 3\r\nHope to start development soon.\r\n\r\n####Week of Monday Oct 27\r\n\r\nThe idea was decided upon.<br>\r\nMay need help integrating Java with C.<br>\r\nDevelopment has not as yet begun on this project\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n# Yisong Yue's log\r\n##### Week of Oct 27\r\nDiscussed and decided on the project idea.\r\n\r\n##### Week of Nov 3\r\nInstalled Eclipse and NDK.<br>\r\nTried to run the emulator with NDK example apps.<br>\r\nRead about JNI and other related things.\r\n\r\n##### Week of Nov 10\r\nReceived the Android phone.<br>\r\nInstalled and ran NDK apps on the phone.<br>\r\nLooked more closely into the native audio app and its code. More reading.\r\n\r\n##### Week of Nov 17\r\nRan and tested the audio-playing portion of the app written by teammates.\r\n\r\n##### Week of Nov 24\r\nThanksgiving break.<br>\r\nLearned about sockets and server-client communication for NDK, and planned for this portion of the app.\r\n\r\n##### Week of Dec 1\r\nWrote some functions to set up clients for receiving and sending data from/to the server.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n# Haozhen Ding's log\r\n##### Week of Oct 27\r\nThe group discussed about project ideas, and made decision on the music player.\r\n\r\n##### Week of Nov 3\r\nFollowed the tutorials for installing NDK and ADT.<br>\r\nLooked at NDK documentations and sample apps.\r\n\r\n##### Week of Nov 10\r\nStudied the native audio playing app and the code.<br>\r\nWrote a simple audio playing app that had a play and a pause button.\r\n\r\n##### Week of Nov 17\r\nLearnt about Android app structures and how to incorporate Java and C code in a app.\r\n\r\n##### Week of Nov 24\r\nThanksgiving break.<br>\r\nMore readings about multi-threading in Android apps using NDK.\r\n\r\n##### Week of Dec 1\r\nTested the server-client communication module of the app.\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/afekete/CS241-Honors/wiki/Groups\r\n######Computer Science<br>University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
